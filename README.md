# Cluedo - Mystery Randomizer

This week's project was to create a Cluedo Game generator by using javascript and more specifically arrays and objects.

General requirement to have three clickable cards that would reveal a murderer, a weapon and a room. There should also be a button to press to reveal the mystery.

## The process

We were giving a bit of code in advance for this project which made it easier to start. I got stuck when creating the random content for the cards just to realize that I was targeting the wrong ID's.
I tried to make a modal to reveal the mystery after pressing the button and I am quite satisfied with how it turned out.
Overall I am happy with my design and I decided not to show so much info on my cards due to that i think it looks better without. I only made it to the blue level of requirements this time but I am happy with it. 

## If I would have had more time

I would have wanted to make the animations on the cards.
I would have made a refresh button.
And I would have created a favourite weapon shuffle.
